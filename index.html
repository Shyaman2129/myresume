            <p>Our team extracts selection data through automated configuration based processes from a variety of online and offline sources.</p>
            <li>As a Java developer, we have developed a Web crawler
                application to pull the data from multiple catalogs, organize
                them into defined formats, and flow this data to create
                datasets for SM that will be utilized by category teams
                across Amazon.</li>
            <li>In order for the other teams to use this information to verify
                and update Amazon catalogs, we will retrieve product
                information from URLs such as product ID, title, category
                type, price, and other specifics about products and organize
                it into the appropriate formats, such as xlxs and csv files.</li>
            <li>We use GIT for code management, Tcorp for task/stories
                management, and AWS Code Star for CI/CD management</li>

                quarters, creating high-quality data and sharing the
                knowledge that I held at the expert level.
